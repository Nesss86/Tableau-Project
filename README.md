# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
For this project I was given two options. One which came with a data set comprised of some csv's, a JSON file, and some pre-determined questions to help generate visualizations and the other which came with a data set but the requirement was to come up with our own questions. I decided to go with option one to achieve the following goals:


1. Determine trends for house prices in Canada over a 40 year period

2. Compare that trend after 2005 with benchmark prices

3. Compare this trend with office prices and determine which was increasing faster

4. Create a heatmap to show

5. Compare house prices to earnings

## Process
### Parse & Clean
I started by parsing the data from the JSON file and created a csv file to load with the others. I utilized the capabilities of Tableau Prep to be able to clean the data to help streamline creating visualizations.

### Connect Data
Once the data was cleaned, outputs were created for each file and connected to Tableau Desktop. Relationships were created so that the combined information could be used to create the graphs for the dashboards.

## Results
(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)
