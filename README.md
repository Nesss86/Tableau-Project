# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
For this project I was given two options. One which came with a data set comprised of some csv's, a JSON file, and some pre-determined questions to help generate visualizations and the other which came with a data set but the requirement was to come up with our own questions. I decided to go with option one to achieve the following goals:


1. Determine trends for house prices in Canada over a 40 year period

2. Compare that trend after 2005 with benchmark prices

3. Compare this trend with office prices and determine which was increasing faster

4. Create a heatmap to show

5. Compare house prices to earnings
