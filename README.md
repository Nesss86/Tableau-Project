# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
For this project I was given two options. One which came with a data set comprised of some csv's, a JSON file, and some pre-determined questions to help generate visualizations and the other which came with a data set but the requirement was to come up with our own questions. I decided to go with option one to achieve the following goals:


1. Determine trends for house prices in Canada over a 40 year period

2. Compare that trend after 2005 with benchmark prices

3. Compare this trend with office prices and determine which was increasing faster

4. Create a heatmap to show

5. Compare house prices to earnings

## Process
### Parse & Clean
I started by parsing the data from the JSON file and created a .csv file to load with the others. I utilized the capabilities of Tableau Prep to be able to clean the data and to help streamline creating visualizations.

### Connect Data
Once the data was cleaned, outputs were created for each file and connected to Tableau Desktop. Relationships were created so that the combined information could be used to create the graphs for the dashboards.

## Results
I chose option one which involved data from the Open Canada Data Portal. I created 5 visulaizations that oultined the following:
 - The trend of house of house prices across Canada in the last 40 years
 - Compare the trend after 2005 with actual benchmark prices
 - Compare this trend with the trend of office prices
 - Create a heatmap of Canada with current house prices for each available district. (While i was not able to accomplish this, I was able to create a symbol map of housing starts and completions per province)
 - Compare trend of house prices with earnings

## Challenges 
The challenges I faced in this project was not having a better comprehensive view of what some of the data was explaining, parsing the data from the JSON file to obtain weekly earnings, and achieving some of my desired visualizations. 

## Future Goals
If I had more time I would research the data more, try to access current data to compare, become more proficient in Tableau to develop a wider range of visualizations.
